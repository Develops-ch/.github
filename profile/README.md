## Description

Develops is your on-demand development team. Get the best out of your startup budget by working with talents from all over the world with our supervision.

### Low costs

We understand the needs and challenges of a project in its early stages and are able to get the most out of small budgets. We collaborate with our clients' technical team or manage the entire development activity, leveraging talents from all over the world.

### Trasparency

We regularly ask for your opinion and ensure that you are always aware of the status of the work. You will know exactly the remuneration of each external collaborator and the cost of each service, to which we will not apply any margin.

### Speed

We know when to pay extreme attention to detail and when to put the pedal to the metal to try out a new idea in tight timeframes and then refine it later if it proves successful. We work with one or few clients at a time to ensure that we maintain concentration and a high delivery pace.

## Team

Develops' core team consists of three members who are involved in the development of various projects for its clients. Although none of the company's repositories are public, the team is committed to using the most innovative and efficient tools to ensure methodologies keep up with technological innovation.
